# Balanced Graph Coloring with VNS
Final project for UFRGS' Combinatory Optimization class (INF05010). It solves the balanced graph coloring problem using the variable neighbourhood search metaheuristic.

---


## Metaheuristic: Variable Neighbourhood Search
- **Neighbourhoods:** [WIP]


## Problem: Balanced Graph Coloring
Defined by [RITT, Marcus (2021)](https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~mrpritt/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=inf05010:t20202.pdf).

- **Instance:** A k-colorable graph G defined by a list of vertices and edges, a list of weights (real numbers) for each vertice and an integer k, representing the number of colours.
- **Solution:** A k-coloring of G.
- **Objective:** Minimize the total weight of the colour with the max weight.
